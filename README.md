# GamePortfolio

## Welcome to my Game Portfolio

Yeah, i know, it's... simple?
I guess?

Well, All my games are there, so you can, of course, see all that code behind them.
Also, you can play them by yourself and find fun!

Consider helping me on the journey! It's very hard to learn about games in Brazil, and the courses are very expensive.
So, if you feel like helping today, well, click on the button above!

NOTE: Since most of the games here are from courses, none of the art is mine! The Credits to the autor are in each project, so go give them love and suport! ^^
