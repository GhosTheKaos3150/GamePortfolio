# Space Shooter

Well, who else had the Nokia 3310?
I did, and it marked me with the space game (Wich I don't remember the name. Sorry).

Making this game was like turning something dead to life again.

This course is amazing and it's from where I came with those games!
Not all, of course!

But, if you understand portuguese and want a great first-experience on making games, that's you start!

If you don't know portuguese or you aren't brazilian like me, you will find great experience in other courses. Maybe I know one or two
of them (I'm a course collector :P). But this one cannot be replaced, I assure you.
