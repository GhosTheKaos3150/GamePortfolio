#Flappy Plane

Creating something is magical!
I've Already felt this when I was a kid, making "games" for my class in RPGMaker XP (I still have it somewhere).

And I felt that while making this game. The idea was from the course, but I've changed somethings to be... more like me? I guess?
Well, making this was amazing!

This course is amazing and it's from where I came with those games!
Not all, of course!

But, if you understand portuguese and want a great first-experience on making games, that's you start!

If you don't know portuguese or you aren't brazilian like me, you will find great experience in other courses. Maybe I know one or two
of them (I'm a course collector :P). But this one cannot be replaced, I assure you.
